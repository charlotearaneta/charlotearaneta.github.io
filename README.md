# 👋 Hi, I’m Charlote Araneta  

### 🚀 HR → Tech | Automation, AI, Systems & Digital Transformation  

I’m an **Automation & AI Workflow Expert** specializing in designing intelligent systems that reduce manual work and improve operational clarity.

I create end-to-end automations, AI-powered workflows, and cloud based systems across HR, operations, and productivity—helping teams save time, reduce errors, and scale with confidence.

## 👩‍💻 About Me  

I began my automation journey in **2021**, initially experimenting with workflow tools to solve real operational problems. What started as curiosity quickly turned into consistent, hands-on work designing systems that connect tools, automate decisions, and eliminate repetitive tasks.

While my professional background is in **Human Resources and Marketing Management**, my automation work extends far beyond HR. Over the years, I’ve built and optimized workflows for **operations, project management, content systems, internal IT processes, and AI-powered tools**.

I consider myself a **generalist by design** comfortable working across domains, tools, and problem spaces. I focus on understanding how systems interact, then building practical automations that are maintainable, scalable, and human-centered.

Today, I work at the intersection of **automation, AI, cloud fundamentals, and digital transformation**, translating real world needs into functional systems.
